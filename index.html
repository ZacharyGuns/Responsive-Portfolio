            <p id="abouttext">I graduated from California State University of Fullerton in May 2017 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Graphic Design. Most of my work is made through Adobe Illustrator with some help from Adobe Photoshop. I am most experienced in print based graphic design, including things such as beer labels, business cards, icons, logos and fliers.</p>
            <p id="abouttext">My hobbies include reading, watching movies, playing video games and above all, scuba diving. There is nothing I would rather be doing than scuba diving. I've dove inside a sunken ship, through dormant lava tubes, drifted along underwater currents and gone as deep as 100 feet below the surface. Most notably, I've dove with sea turtles, manta rays and hammerhead sharks!</p>
